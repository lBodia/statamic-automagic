# Automagic

**Real magic for your form templates.**

This addon provides key/value pairs for submission data inside email templates. While Statamic's native `automagic` feature is useful, sometimes you need a little extra control over the email template design which forces you to write out all the variables present in the formset, as well as update the email template whenever the formset changes!
